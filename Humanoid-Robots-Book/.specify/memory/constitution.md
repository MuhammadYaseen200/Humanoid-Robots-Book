# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

### I. Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

Every feature MUST follow the Constitution → Specification → Planning → Tasks → Implementation → Documentation workflow. No implementation begins without an approved specification. All work MUST be traceable to a spec document in `specs/<feature-name>/`.


**Rationale**: Prevents scope drift, ensures clarity before coding, and creates reusable documentation for future agents and human learners.

### II. Reusable Intelligence

Every design decision, solution pattern, and lesson learned MUST be captured in Docusaurus markdown under `/docs`. This documentation serves dual purposes: (1) educational content for learners, (2) long-term memory for AI agents. Before solving any problem, agents MUST query existing documentation to avoid redundant work.

**Rationale**: Creates a flywheel where the project becomes smarter over time. Documentation is not an afterthought but the primary knowledge base that powers both human learning and AI agent effectiveness.

The system MUST be designed as a network of specialized Claude Code agents coordinated through slash commands and skills. Each agent has a clearly defined role (Writer, Planner, Implementer, QA, etc.) and operates through the Spec-Kit Plus workflow. Human involvement is reserved for strategic decisions, clarifications, and approvals.

**Rationale**: Enables 95% AI execution / 5% human oversight ratio. Agents working with predefined skills and specifications produce consistent, high-quality output faster than manual development.

### IV. Independent Testability

Every user story in specifications MUST be independently testable and deliverable as a viable MVP increment. Features are prioritized (P1, P2, P3...) and each can be developed, tested, and deployed without dependencies on lower-priority stories.

**Rationale**: Enables incremental delivery, parallel development by multiple agents, and early validation of core functionality. If only User Story 1 is implemented, the system should still provide tangible value.

### V. RAG-Native Learning Experience

The textbook MUST embed a RAG chatbot powered by OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDK, FastAPI, Neon Serverless Postgres, and Qdrant Cloud. The chatbot MUST answer questions about full-chapter content AND user-selected text snippets. All book content MUST be ingested into vector embeddings for semantic retrieval.

**Rationale**: Transforms passive reading into interactive learning. Students can query concepts, get clarifications on complex topics (ROS 2, Isaac Sim, humanoid kinematics), and receive personalized explanations based on their background.

### VI. Personalization & Accessibility

The system MUST implement Better Auth for signup/signin and collect user background (software/hardware experience) at registration. Logged-in users MUST be able to: (1) personalize content difficulty per chapter via button, (2) translate content to Urdu per chapter via button. Personalization adjusts technical depth based on user profile.

**Rationale**: Accommodates diverse learner backgrounds (beginners to advanced). Urdu translation supports Pakistan-based Panaversity students. Personalization ensures content matches skill level, preventing frustration or boredom.

### VII. Hackathon Scoring Optimization

Development priorities MUST align with hackathon point allocation: (1) Base book + RAG chatbot = 100 points, (2) Reusable intelligence via subagents/skills = +50 bonus, (3) Better Auth + background collection = +50 bonus, (4) Content personalization = +50 bonus, (5) Urdu translation = +50 bonus. Maximum achievable score: 300 points.

**Rationale**: Focuses effort on high-value features. Base functionality ensures qualification; bonus features demonstrate advanced capabilities that differentiate top submissions and showcase industrial-grade agent workflows.

## Technology Stack Requirements

**Frontend**: Docusaurus v3.x for book hosting, React.js + Tailwind CSS for interactive components, Better Auth for authentication.

**Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+) for RAG API, OpenAI Agents SDK / ChatKit SDK for conversational AI, Neon Serverless Postgres for user data and chat history, Qdrant Cloud (Free Tier) for vector embeddings.

**Deployment**: GitHub Pages or Vercel for static site, FastAPI backend on cloud provider with Neon/Qdrant integration.

**Development Tools**: Claude Code CLI as primary orchestrator, Spec-Kit Plus for SDD workflow, MCP servers (Context-7, File System, GitHub, Knowledge Base) for agent capabilities.

**AI Models**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 for spec/plan/task generation, OpenAI GPT-4 for chatbot and content personalization, OpenAI Whisper (referenced in course material, not implemented in book directly).

**Constraints**:
- All API keys stored in `.env` (never committed)
- Qdrant limited to 1GB free tier - chunk strategy required
- Neon Serverless Postgres 0.5GB free tier - efficient schema design mandatory
- Demo video MUST be under 90 seconds for hackathon submission

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Specification
1. Run `/sp.specify "<feature-description>"` to generate `specs/<feature>/spec.md`
2. Review user stories, acceptance criteria, and functional requirements
3. Run `/sp.clarify` if requirements are ambiguous
4. Obtain human approval before proceeding

### Phase 2: Planning
1. Run `/sp.plan` to generate `specs/<feature>/plan.md` with technical architecture
2. Verify Constitution Check passes or document complexity justifications
3. Generate data models, API contracts, and project structure
4. Run `/sp.adr` for architecturally significant decisions (e.g., RAG architecture, auth strategy)
5. Obtain human approval before proceeding

### Phase 3: Task Generation
1. Run `/sp.tasks` to generate `specs/<feature>/tasks.md` from approved plan
2. Tasks MUST be organized by user story with priority labels (P1, P2, P3)
3. Each task includes exact file paths and dependency markers `[P]` for parallel execution
4. Foundational tasks (database, auth, base models) MUST be in Phase 2 - blocking all user stories

### Phase 4: Implementation
1. Run `/sp.implement` to execute tasks from `tasks.md`
2. Agents work in priority order: Setup → Foundational → User Story 1 → User Story 2...
3. After each user story phase, validate independent functionality
4. Commit incrementally with PHR documentation via `/sp.phr`

### Phase 5: Review & Deployment
1. Run `/sp.analyze` for cross-artifact consistency check (spec, plan, tasks)
2. Run `/sp.git.commit_pr` to commit changes and create pull request
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages/Vercel
4. Generate demo video (under 90 seconds) showing: (a) book navigation, (b) RAG chatbot interaction, (c) personalization/translation features

## Quality Gates

### Specification Gate (Before Planning)
- [ ] All user stories have acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format

- [ ] Functional requirements numbered (FR-001, FR-002...) and testable
- [ ] Success criteria measurable and technology-agnostic
- [ ] Edge cases documented

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and style guides. All agents, slash commands, and human contributors MUST verify compliance with these principles before completing work.

### Amendment Procedure
1. Proposed changes documented in new spec under `specs/constitution-update/`
2. Run `/sp.constitution` with updated requirements
3. Version incremented per semantic versioning:
   - **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible principle removals or redefinitions
   - **MINOR**: New principle added or materially expanded guidance
   - **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording fixes, non-semantic refinements
4. All dependent templates (plan, spec, tasks, command files) updated for consistency
5. Changes merged only after human approval

### Compliance Review
- Every `/sp.plan` execution MUST include Constitution Check section
- Every `/sp.analyze` execution verifies spec/plan/tasks alignment with constitution
- Complexity violations (e.g., exceeding Qdrant free tier, overly complex architecture) MUST be justified in Complexity Tracking table

### Conflict Resolution
If constitution conflicts with external requirements (hackathon rules, API limitations, deployment constraints), constitution takes precedence unless explicitly amended. Document conflicts as ADRs using `/sp.adr`.
